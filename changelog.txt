$size[14]{$u{Update for 18.02.2024 (Latikai):}}
  * Well, it's been a while since a changelog! Almost made it to 10 years...
  * Merged in changes for new haven.
  * Swapped wiki to salemthegame.wiki.
  * Tried not to break anything else.

$size[14]{$u{Update for 31.12.15 (Latikai):}}
  * Included scarecrows for the radius display. Might require a fix for scarecrows in other seasons, but I hope not.
  * Added a button that lets you choose which server you connect to for authenticating. This is be remembered over client restarts, and should allow popham players to connect even though providence is down.
  * The client will now state which type of object is highlighted when you (or someone else) alt-clicks an object in the world. Particularily handy for knowing which fruit tree is flowering.
  * The wiki was now changed to salemwiki.info again. May require you to empty out ~/Salem/cache.

$size[14]{$u{Update for 07.11.15 (Latikai):}}
  * Fixed crash for inventory sorting with stuff on fishing rods.
  * New default radar.xml (will not replace your old settings until you delete ~/Salem/radar.xml)
 
$size[14]{$u{Update for 07.11.15 (Latikai):}}
  * Radar update: you can now choose whether or not to show icons, and which order to display icons in.

$size[14]{$u{Update for 04.0.15 (thanks to lcy03406):}}

  * Auto-sifting is now in! For now, this is completely automatic until I get enough complaints that it should be made an option.
